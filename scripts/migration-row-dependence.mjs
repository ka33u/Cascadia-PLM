/**
 * Which statements in a migration have an outcome that depends on rows that
 * were already in the database.
 *
 * This is the classifier behind the ratchet in `check-migration-backfills.mjs`,
 * which fails when such a migration ships without a scenario proving what it
 * does to real rows. It lives in its own module because a lint that quietly
 * stops matching is indistinguishable from a clean tree — the exact failure the
 * ratchet exists to prevent one level up — so it has a test of its own, and a
 * test cannot import a file that connects to a database on load.
 *
 * "Depends on rows" is two families, not one. The writes — `UPDATE`, `DELETE`,
 * `INSERT` — are the obvious half. The other half is DDL Postgres validates
 * against every existing row before it will commit: `ADD CONSTRAINT`,
 * `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`, `SET NOT NULL`, a `NOT NULL` column added without a
 * default, a column whose type changes, and `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`. Those are
 * precisely the statements that *abort* an upgrade rather than silently doing
 * nothing, and an empty database judges them no better than it judges a
 * backfill. Classifying only the writes is how a constraint-validating
 * migration once shipped with no scenario at all.
