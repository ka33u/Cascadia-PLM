/**
 * Assert the invariant: **a test that overrides a shared config row puts it
 * back.**
 *
 *   npm run test:hygiene:check
 *
 * `item_type_configs` and `workflow_definitions` hold one row per item type
 * for the whole instance. A suite that overrides one in `beforeAll` writes
 * outside the per-test gate transaction, so the write is permanent: the row
 * survives the suite, the file, and the run. Six suites did exactly that and
 * never wrote the row back, so which lifecycle `Task` pointed at depended on
 * which suite had last touched the database — and a test that read it was
 * asserting on file order.
 *
 * `overrideItemTypeConfig` (in `__tests__/fixtures/lifecycles.ts`) captures the
 * row first and returns the undo. This gate says: if a test file writes one of
 * those tables with `onConflictDoUpdate`, it must be going through that helper.
 *
 * A file that genuinely does not need the helper — because its override lives
 * inside the gate transaction and is undone before the rollback — declares
 * that with a `test-config-hygiene:` comment giving the reason. There is
 * exactly one such file today.
 *
 * Deliberately a grep, not an analysis. It is the fast half — the authority is
 * the acceptance check that the config rows still point at their defaults after
 * a full run. A determined reformatting can slip past this; the point is to
 * catch the next copy-paste, which is how all six got there.
