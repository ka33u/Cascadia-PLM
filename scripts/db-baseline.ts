/**
 * Record the committed migrations a database already satisfies as applied —
 * without executing them.
 *
 * Every install created before v0.5 got its schema from `db:push`, which
 * writes no migration journal. Running `db:migrate` against such a database
 * would replay `0000_*.sql` from the top, try to CREATE TABLE over live
 * tables, and fail — or worse, partially apply. This script is the bridge: it
 * works out which committed migrations the live schema *already* satisfies,
 * records exactly those, and leaves the rest for `db:migrate` to apply for
 * real.
 *
 *   npm run db:baseline                       # enterprise tree
 *   CASCADIA_APP=cascadia npm run db:baseline # community tree
 *   npm run db:baseline -- --check            # report only, write nothing
 *
 * In Docker: docker exec <app-container> node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/db-baseline.ts
 *
 * Fresh installs never need this: `db:migrate` on an empty database applies
 * the baseline itself, journal included.
 *
 * ## Why the position is measured rather than assumed
 *
 * Drizzle's migrator does not check migrations off one at a time. It reads the
 * single newest row in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` and applies every
 * migration whose folder timestamp is greater than it:
 *
 *     select id, hash, created_at from drizzle.__drizzle_migrations
 *       order by created_at desc limit 1
 *     ... if (!last || Number(last.created_at) < migration.folderMillis) apply
 *
 * (`drizzle-orm/pg-core/dialect.js`, `PgDialect.migrate`.) The journal is a
 * high-water mark, not a set. Recording a migration whose SQL never ran does
 * not merely mislabel one row — it moves the mark past that migration for
 * good. `db:migrate` then reports success having applied nothing, and the
 * columns and constraints it skipped surface much later as application errors
 * nobody connects back to the upgrade.
 *
 * So this script does not take the operator's word for where the database
 * sits. It compares the live schema against the snapshot drizzle commits
 * beside every migration, and records only the prefix that actually matches.
 * A database one migration short of the tree gets that one migration left
 * pending, not stamped over.
 *
 * ## What is compared
 *
 * Table names, column names and their nullability, and the names of indexes,
 * foreign keys, unique constraints and check constraints — against
 * `meta/NNNN_snapshot.json`, which is drizzle's own record of what the schema
 * looked like at that migration.
 *
 * Primary keys are excluded on purpose: drizzle names composite ones and
 * leaves single-column ones for Postgres to name, so the two sides disagree by
 * construction rather than by drift. Column types, defaults and collations are
 * not compared either. What remains is enough to tell any two committed
 * migrations apart — `db:check-baseline` proves that on every migration in the
 * tree, so a future migration that this comparison could not distinguish fails
 * CI rather than being silently mis-stamped here.
 *
 * With one deliberate exception: a migration that changes rows and nothing
 * else. No reading of a schema can show whether such a migration has run, so
 * the placement stops before it and says so, and `db:migrate` applies it —
 * every migration of that kind is written, and checked, to be safe to apply
 * to a database that already carries its effect.
 *
 * Objects no snapshot mentions — a reporting table someone added by hand — are
 * reported and then ignored. They say nothing about which migration the
 * database is at, which is the only question being asked.
