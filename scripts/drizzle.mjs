 *
 * The drizzle config lives in the app, because the schema is composed there —
 * `modules.schema.ts` is a re-export, and drizzle-kit reads it statically. So
 * every `db:*` script has to name an app, and naming `cascadia-enterprise`
 * outright is what made `npm run db:push` a broken script in the published
 * tree: the app it points at is not in that tree at all.
 *
 * Resolving instead means one script serves both editions. Same reasoning as
 * `truncate-all.ts` and `snapshot-openapi.ts`, which already do this.
 *
 * **Runs from the app directory.** The config's `schema: './src/modules.schema.ts'`
 * and `out: './drizzle'` are relative to the config, and drizzle-kit
 * resolves them against the working directory instead. Invoked from the repo
 * root it therefore looked for `<root>/src/modules.schema.ts` and failed with
 * "No schema files found" — which is what `npm run db:push` has done in *both*
 * editions since the Phase 2 split moved the config under `apps/`. It went
 * unnoticed because every existing database had already been pushed; the
 * published tree, having no database at all, is where it finally surfaced.
