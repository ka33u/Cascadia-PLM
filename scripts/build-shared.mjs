 * ESM entry starts with `import { createRequire } from 'module'` gets that
 * import emitted verbatim into the same bundle, and the two top-level bindings
 * collide:
 *
 *   SyntaxError: Identifier 'createRequire' has already been declared
 *
 * fflate/esm/index.mjs does exactly this, which broke every production boot.
 * Importing under a private alias keeps the banner collision-proof regardless
 * of what a dependency does.
 *
 * The `require` const itself needs no alias: esbuild knows `require` is
 * significant on platform: 'node' and renames a dependency's own top-level
 * `require` binding out of the way (fflate's becomes `require2`).
