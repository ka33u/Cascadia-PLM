/**
 * Document Lifecycle E2E Journey
 *
 * One journey, end to end, in the change-order-workflow/bom-management style: create a
 * document through the UI, find it through the same list query the documents
 * grid runs, and delete it through the UI — reading the server back after each
 * mutation rather than trusting the page that performed it.
 *
 * What it replaces: four tests, two of which were pure navigation smoke —
 * "clicking New lands on /documents/new", "the create form renders its
 * fields" — with no invariant behind either, and a list test that typed into
 * the grid's search box and slept 500ms hoping the filter had run.
 *
 * The UI *edit* leg is deliberately absent, and it is the one step of the
 * lifecycle this journey cannot assert today. The document detail page PUTs
 * the whole row back, and `documentUpdateSchema` refuses `null` on `fileId`
 * and `fileName` — which is exactly what a read returns for a document with
 * no file attached. `partUpdateSchema` was made nullable for this precise
 * reason when body validation landed; the document schema was not. Until it
 * is, a save from that page is a 400, and a step here would assert a known
 * break rather than guard against a new one.
