## Core Item Types

Thirteen core PLM item types are implemented with full CRUD operations, registered
through `ItemTypeRegistry`. (Programs and designs are the organizational hierarchy
_above_ items, not item types — see [Program & Design Hierarchy](#program--design-hierarchy).)

| Item Type            | Status | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Part**             | ✅     | Parts with materials, partType (Manufacture/Purchase/Phantom/Software), cost, lead times                                                                                   |
| **Document**         | ✅     | Version-controlled files with check-in/check-out                                                                                                                           |
| **Change Order**     | ✅     | ECO/ECN/MCO/Deviation change orders, each on its own branch                                                                                                                |
| **Requirement**      | ✅     | Requirements tracking with acceptance criteria, priority, source. Coverage counts links: "verified" means a VERIFIED_BY edge to a test case exists, not that a test passed |
| **Task**             | ✅     | Work items with assignees, due dates, estimated/actual hours                                                                                                               |
| **Test Plan**        | ✅     | Verification planning: scope, environment, entry/exit criteria, grouped test cases                                                                                         |
| **Test Case**        | ✅     | Executable verification with recorded execution history (NotRun/Passed/Failed/Blocked)                                                                                     |
| **Work Instruction** | ✅     | Rich step-by-step manufacturing instructions with parametric data                                                                                                          |
| **Issue**            | ✅     | Defect/quality tracking with severity, category, root cause; dedicated list/detail UI and spreadsheet import                                                               |
| **Tool**             | ✅     | Manufacturing/quality/utility equipment as non-versioned records (the Tool pattern)                                                                                        |
| **Software**         | ✅     | Firmware/software configuration items with a content-addressed source store — see [Software Management](#software-management)                                              |
| **Work Order**       | ✅     | Manufacturing execution: traveler, material consumption, qualification — see [Physical Traceability](#physical-traceability)                                               |
| **Physical Part**    | ✅     | Serialized units and identified lots of a Part — see [Physical Traceability](#physical-traceability)                                                                       |

### Two-Table Pattern

Every item type follows the unified architecture:

- **Base `items` table**: Common fields (itemNumber, revision, state, masterId, etc.)
- **Type-specific table**: Domain fields (parts.material, documents.fileType, etc.)

This enables unified queries across all items while maintaining type-specific data integrity.

## Physical Traceability

Identity and genealogy for real material — which unit was built from which lot,
and what evidence says it met its requirements. Deliberately stops short of
quantity and value: no inventory balances, no costing.

### Physical Parts ✅

| Feature              | Status | Notes                                                                         |

| PhysicalPart item    | ✅     | A physical instance of a Part: a serialized **unit** or an identified **lot** |

| Dual identity        | ✅     | `PP-000001` as a stable handle; serial or lot number as the display identity  |
| Registration         | ✅     | `POST /api/v1/physical-parts/register`                                        |

| Production edges      | ✅     | `Produces` relationships from work order to built instance           |
| Derived, never stored | ✅     | Walked on demand, so it cannot drift from the records it summarizes  |
| Forward traversal     | ✅     | `GET /api/v1/physical-parts/:id/genealogy`                           |
