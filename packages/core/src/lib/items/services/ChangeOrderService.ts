   * outside every boundary — which is how every ECO in the instance came to
   * be visible to every user, and how the `canCreateEco` and `canApproveEco`

   *
   * The designs are equal and unordered; the first is not special. Nothing is
   * written to `items.designId`, which stays NULL on change orders precisely
   * so that no design can read as the primary one.
   *
   * Linking is part of the creation, not a follow-up. Both call sites that
   * used to link afterwards did so best-effort — one logged a warning and
   * carried on, the other swallowed rejections from `Promise.allSettled` —
   * so a failure there left exactly the design-less ECO this refuses to make.
   * If a link fails, the change order is removed and the error raised.
   *
   * So is starting the workflow. Three creators used to call
   * `autoStartWorkflow` afterwards — the route and the AI tool swallowed a
   * failure with a warning, the design engine threw — and none rolled the
   * change order back, so a missing workflow configuration left a change
   * order with no instance: every `/workflow` endpoint answered 404, and the
   * editable-change-orders list offered it because it had no instance to be
   * locked. A change order exists with its designs, its branches and a

   * wholesale and reverted whatever the other change order had released.
   * `keep_theirs` pointed the branch at main's row and left the item listed

   * - **Advance** it — submit, release, cancel: reach to every linked design,
   *   which is this.
   *
   * Advancing is grouped with voting rather than with reading because of what
   * a final transition does, not what it is called. A release merges every
   * linked design's branch and stamps permanent revision letters across all of

   * included because it locks the ECO's scope, and because it is the cheap,
   * reversible end of the same rule — rework back to an initial state clears
   * the lock again.
   *
   * The approval vote is not a backstop for any of this: `approvalRequirement`
   * defaults to zero wherever a transition declares none, and workflows are
   * user-authored, so a releasing transition that requires no votes at all is
   * a legal configuration. This is the only gate on that path.
