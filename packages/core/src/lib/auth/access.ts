 * That is a *read* policy, decided once in `canAccessDesign`.
 *
 * Three write routes re-derived it inline as `if (design.programId) { …role
 * check… }` with no else, which silently extends "everyone may see it" to
 * "everyone may change it": `DELETE /tags/:id` destroys a named release or
 * baseline pointer on that reasoning, and `PUT /branches/:id` archives a
 * branch, discarding in-flight work. Neither declared a permission tuple
 * either, so nothing else stood behind the fall-through.
 *
 * So the null arm here closes rather than opens, which is the rule this
 * codebase has already applied twice to the same shape: a work order naming no
 * program (`requireWorkOrderAccess` below) and a change order linking no
 * design are both reachable by cross-program authority alone.
 *
 * Cross-program authority is checked first so it also covers the null arm — an
 * administrator can still reach an unassigned design in order to assign it.
 * `PUT /branches/:id` gains that bypass, which its inline check never
 * consulted: a cross-program administrator could not previously lock a branch
 * in a program they were not a member of.

 * part". Type permission is instance-blind, so without this a viewer in one
 * program could read, and in several places write, every item in every other
 * program by knowing an id.
 *
 * Four types are delegated rather than checked here, all for one reason: their
 * `items.designId` is NULL, so the `item.designId` arm below passes vacuously
 * and gates nothing at all.
 *
 *  - ChangeOrder → `requireChangeOrderAccess`. An ECO's designs hang off
 *    `change_order_designs`.
 *  - Issue → `requireIssueAccess`, for that reason and one more: an issue may
 *    carry a design, a program, a set of design links, or none of them, and
 *    the arm below sees only the first.
 *  - WorkOrder → `requireWorkOrderAccess`. A work order is not versioned and
 *    belongs to no design; it names `work_orders.program_id` directly.
 *  - PhysicalPart → `requirePhysicalPartAccess`. An instance is authorized as
 *    the part it is an instance of, through `physical_parts.part_master_id`.
 *
 * These are the same four types `SELF_SCOPED_ITEM_TYPES` names in
 * `@/lib/db/filters`, and each arm here is the one-row twin of that type's arm
 * in `accessScopeCondition`. Both surfaces have to draw the boundary in the
 * same place: one admitting what the other refuses is the failure these arms
 * exist to fix. The last two arms landed after the first two, and until they
 * did, a work order or a physical instance was gated by authentication alone
 * on 31 generic-router surfaces plus the AI/MCP tool handlers, while the item
 * list and both typed routers refused the very same rows.
 *
 * Dispatching here rather than only from `routes/issues.ts`, `work-orders.ts`
 * and `physical-parts.ts` is what covers the generic `/items/:id` sub-routes —
 * transition, lock, relationships, files, checkout — and the AI tool handlers,
 * which all reach those types through this one function and no other.
 *
 * Two consequences of the last two arms, both intended. A work order whose
 * `program_id` is NULL fails closed to everyone without `programs:manage` here
 * as it already does on the typed routes and in every list — administrators
 * keep reach precisely so they can repair the row. And both helpers throw
 * `NotFoundError` when the child row is missing, so an `items` row of either
 * type with no `work_orders` / `physical_parts` row answers 404 rather than
 * passing; the two-table pattern makes that unreachable, but it is a status
 * change, not only a 403 change.
 *
 * A Task is deliberately *not* dispatched, and that silence is a ruling rather
 * than the oversight it resembles. A task carries no design of its own, so it
 * falls through to the `item.designId` arm below — which for a design-less row
 * passes vacuously — and stays reachable by any authenticated caller holding
 * `tasks:read`. `tasks.program_id` exists but nothing supplies it, and the
 * chain a reader reaches for, `assignee` → `program_members`, is a circle
 * rather than a derivation: it takes the boundary from the very membership
 * table the boundary is checked against, and resolves "exactly one" only on a
 * single-program install, where it looks right while being wrong by
 * construction. The full reasoning — including why requiring a program is a
 * two-part product change rather than a predicate flip — is recorded on
 * `accessScopeCondition` in `@/lib/db/filters`, and it is recorded in both
 * places on purpose: this gate and that predicate must not drift, because one
 * surface admitting what the other refuses is the failure the ChangeOrder and
 * Issue arms exist to fix.
 *
 * Takes an id or a row already in hand, and returns the row, so a handler that
 * needs the item does not read it twice. Soft-deleted items are deliberately
 * not filtered out here. `items.isDeleted` is the authoritative marker the rest
 * of the system keys on — always through `notDeleted()` in `@/lib/db/filters`,
 * which is now its only spelling — and `deletedAt`/`deletedBy` are the audit
 * stamp the ECO merge writes alongside it (`ChangeOrderMergeService`,
 * the `changeType === 'deleted'` arm), never on their own and never read back.
 * This helper answers authorization only: a soft-deleted row keeps its
 * `designId`, so the boundary drawn here is still the right one, and existence
 * policy stays with the readers that already elide or 404 such rows.
 *
 * Lives beside `requireFileAccess` for the same reason it does: a module
 * contributing an item action can reuse it without importing a route module.
