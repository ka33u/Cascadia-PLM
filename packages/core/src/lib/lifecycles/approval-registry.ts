/**
 * Lets an optional module participate in approval voting without core knowing
 * the module exists.
 *
 * Core owns the vote: the permission checks, the duplicate-vote guard, the
 * insert, and the transaction around it. A module can veto a vote before it is
 * written (`beforeVote`) and write its own rows in the same transaction after
 * it is (`afterVote`). Core ships zero interceptors — with none registered,
 * voting behaves exactly as it did before this seam existed.
 *
 * `afterVote` runs **inside** the vote's transaction and is handed the `tx`
 * handle deliberately. Advanced Auditing's signature has to commit or roll back
 * with the vote it authorizes; an approval that exists without its signature,
 * or a signature without its approval, is a compliance defect rather than a
 * cosmetic one. Anything registered here inherits that guarantee, so do not
 * reach for `db` inside an interceptor — use the `tx` you are given.
