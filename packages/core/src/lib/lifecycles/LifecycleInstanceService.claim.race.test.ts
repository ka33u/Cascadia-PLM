/**
 * The release claim under real concurrency
 *
 * Data-integrity gate. `claimRelease` is what stops one workflow instance
 * being released twice: the close path claims the instance, merges branches
 * and assigns revision letters, and a second close arriving mid-flight would
 * mint a second set of revisions for the same change. The claim is a
 * compare-and-swap — one `UPDATE` whose `WHERE` carries the whole precondition
 * (still in the expected state, not completed, and either unclaimed or claimed
 * so long ago the claimant must be dead) — so the row lock decides the winner
 * and every loser sees zero rows affected.
 *
 * That is exactly the property `TestDatabase` cannot check. Its single
 * connection inside one gate transaction serializes every caller, so a claim
 * test written there never touches a row lock: it would pass just as happily
 * against a check-then-write that reads `releasingAt`, finds it null, and
 * writes — the shape that hands the release to everyone who asks. The serial
 * tests beside `LifecycleInstanceService.test.ts`'s transition-hardening block pin the
 * policy (a live claim blocks, a stale one is taken over); this file is the
 * half that pins the atomicity, on real connections that commit.
 *
 * `ConcurrentTestDatabase` tracks users, programs and designs. A workflow
 * definition is none of those, so this file owns that cleanup — instances
 * cascade from their item, but the definition outlives it and its name is
 * unique, so leaving one behind would poison the next run.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run packages/core/src/lib/lifecycles/LifecycleInstanceService.claim.race.test.ts
