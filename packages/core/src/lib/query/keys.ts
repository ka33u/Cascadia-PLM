/**
 * Central query-key registry.

 * Every cached read in the app is keyed through this module so that a
 * mutation can invalidate by resource without knowing which component or
 * route loader happens to hold the data. Keys are hierarchical:
 *
 *   [resource]                       — everything for a resource
 *   [resource, 'list']               — every list variant
 *   [resource, 'list', params]       — one list variant
 *   [resource, 'detail', id]         — one entity
 *   [resource, 'detail', id, sub]    — a sub-collection of one entity
 *
 * Because TanStack Query matches `invalidateQueries` by key *prefix*,
 * invalidating `['parts']` reaches every list variant and every detail
 * page for parts, mounted or not.
