/**
 * ConflictReviewService Tests
 *
 * A conflict review is an acknowledgement, not a resolution: an engineer marks
 * a warning-level merge conflict as "seen" so it stops counting against the
 * ECO's unreviewed-warning tally. The acknowledgement is only honest for as
 * long as the conflict it acknowledged is the conflict that is still there —
 * so every review stores a signature of the conflict's content, and a review
 * whose signature no longer matches is reported back as needing re-review.
 * Without that, editing the item after acknowledgement would leave a stale
 * "reviewed" badge sitting on top of a changed conflict, and the change would
 * reach release unseen.
 *
 * Acknowledgements accumulate: markAsReviewed appends a row per call rather
 * than replacing the previous one, so a re-acknowledgement — including the
 * product's Mark Reviewed button, which sends no notes — can never destroy an
 * earlier reviewer's note. The newest acknowledgement per conflict key decides
 * review status; the rest ride along as reviewHistory.
 *
 * Data-integrity gate: the signature is what stops an acknowledgement from
 * masking a conflict it never covered, and accumulation is what stops a
 * re-acknowledgement from destroying the record of who accepted what and why.
 * Complex-algorithm gate: the signature is a hash over field conflicts that
 * arrive in whatever order detection produced them, so it must sort before
 * hashing or the same conflict hashes two ways and every review looks stale.
 *
 * The suite tests the service contract the four /conflict-reviews endpoints
 * consume; it does not run detection itself, which is covered by
 * ConflictDetectionService.test.ts.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run packages/core/src/lib/services/ConflictReviewService.test.ts
