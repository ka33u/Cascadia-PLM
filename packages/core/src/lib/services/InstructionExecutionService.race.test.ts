/**
 * Opening a traveler run under real concurrency
 *
 * Data-integrity gate. `InstructionExecutionService.start` did a resume
 * SELECT and then a bare INSERT — no transaction, no lock, no ON CONFLICT.
 * Two requests that both read "no open run" both inserted, and the traveler's
 * countable tally (`WorkOrderInstructionService.deriveStatus`,
 * `completedCount >= line.requiredCount`) then counted one physical run twice
 * toward the gate that decides whether a work order may be completed. The
 * manufacturing record said a procedure had been performed twice when it had
 * been performed once.
 *
 * `uq_instr_exec_open_run` — partial on `status = 'In Progress'`, keyed on
 * (line, technician, COALESCE(unit_label,'')) — makes the loser of that race
 * fail, and `start` re-reads and hands back the winner, so a race is
 * indistinguishable from a resume.
 *
 * The same gate covers the auto-start on the other side of that insert.
 * `start()` walks a Not Started order along its lifecycle before opening the
 * run, and that walk was get-then-create: simultaneous FIRST runs left one
 * winner and every other caller holding an "already exists" / "concurrent
 * transition" failure with no execution row at all. These cases therefore
 * race the first run deliberately — there is no warm-up.
 *
 * This cannot be tested under `TestDatabase`: one connection inside one
 * transaction serializes every call, so the race cannot occur. These commit
 * for real through `ConcurrentTestDatabase`, which cleans up after itself.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run packages/core/src/lib/services/InstructionExecutionService.race.test.ts
