 * Vault storage interface - abstracts the underlying storage mechanism
 * Implementations: LocalFileStorage, S3Storage (Phase 2), etc.
 *
 * Throw contract, binding on every implementation: a `path` that traverses
 * outside the vault root (contains `..`, or is absolute) throws
 * `ValidationError` from `@/lib/errors`; a `path` the backend does not hold
 * throws `NotFoundError` from `retrieve`, `createReadStream`, and `getSize`.
 * These propagate through `handleApiError`, which classifies by error class
 * (`ValidationError` -> 400, `NotFoundError` -> 404) — an implementation that
 * throws a bare `Error` for either case degrades that refusal to a 500 with
 * its message replaced by "An unexpected error occurred", and logs an
 * operational client error as a non-operational server fault. A backend
 * fault genuinely outside the client's control (e.g. a malformed response
 * from the storage service) may still throw untyped.
