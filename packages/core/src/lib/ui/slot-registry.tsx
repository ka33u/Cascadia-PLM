 * decision about where the UI can be extended and what data is available
 * there — not something a module invents by widening a type. So the names and
 * their props are declared here, and modules supply components that satisfy
 * them. That direction also keeps the props honest: core can only offer what it
 * actually has in scope at the render site.
 *
 * A slot with nothing registered renders nothing, which is what lets core's
 * components run unchanged with every optional package absent.
 *
 * This is for **presentational** extension. When a module also needs to feed
 * state back — gate a submit button, add fields to a request — use a purpose-
 * built registry instead; `approval-form-registry.tsx` is the worked example.
