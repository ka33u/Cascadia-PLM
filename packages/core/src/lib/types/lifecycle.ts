/**

 * "unreleased". The marker has to be a real, non-empty revision string for
 * that distinction to survive the released-item queries: the empty string is
 * read as a working marker by both `RevisionService.isWorkingRevision` and its
 * SQL counterpart `notWorkingRevision()`, so an item released at `''` is
 * invisible to every released-item fallback (`VersionResolver`, design
 * baselines) — released in name and unreleased in every query.
 *
 * Constrained by the database, not by taste: `items.revision` is
 * `varchar(10)`, `ck_items_revision_working_marker` rejects any value starting
 * with '-' that is not '-' or '-{8 hex}', and 'DRAFT'/'' are the legacy
 * working markers. 'N/A' satisfies all of that and reads correctly in a
 * revision column.
 *
 * Lives here rather than on `RevisionService` so the client-side scheme
 * selector can show the real marker without importing server code;
 * `RevisionService.NO_REVISION` re-exports it for server callers.

 * carries `-{branchId8}` (see `RevisionService.getWorkingRevision`) to keep two
 * branches' copies of the same item apart. That branch id is an implementation
 * detail of the constraint, not a revision, and rendering it puts a string like
 * '-01704247' in a Rev column. Every read-only revision display runs through
