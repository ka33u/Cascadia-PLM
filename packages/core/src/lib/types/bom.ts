 * `isBranchChanged` that the change-order endpoint emits, the design-structure
 * copy was missing `masterId`, `isInEco` and `changeAction`, and the two server
 * copies disagreed on whether `name` could be null.

 * This is the one declaration. Fields that only one producer emits are
 * optional and say so, which is the honest encoding — a consumer reading a tree
 * cannot tell which endpoint built it from the type alone, so anything not
