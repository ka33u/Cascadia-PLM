/**
 * Restrict a query on `items` to what the caller may read.
 *
 * Returns `null` when there is nothing to restrict — `undefined`/`null` scope
 * is cross-program authority, which sees everything. Callers push a non-null
 * result onto their condition list and otherwise leave the query untouched.
 *
 * An empty axis is not `null`: `designIds: []` means the caller reaches no
 * program design at all, and must not fall through to "everything".
 *
 * **Design-less admission is a per-type rule, not a blanket one.** An item
 * with `items.designId IS NULL` is admitted to everyone only when its type has
 * no other axis to be scoped on — a Tool sits outside every program, so there
 * is no boundary to isolate it across, which is the same thing
 * `AccessControlService.canAccessDesign` decides about a program-less design.
 * Four types do carry an axis of their own and are scoped on it instead:
 *
 *  - ChangeOrder, through `change_order_designs` (`changeOrderAccessScopeCondition`)
 *  - WorkOrder, through `work_orders.program_id`
 *  - PhysicalPart, through its part's lineage
 *  - Issue, through whichever of its three axes it carries
 *
 * Each arm reproduces that type's own by-id gate in `@/lib/auth/access`, so a
 * row can never be listed by one surface and refused by the other. Blanket
 * design-less admission is what let a work order the by-id gate refuses still
 * appear in the item list.
 *
 * That correspondence is now true of all four arms rather than aspirational
 * for two: `requireItemAccess` dispatches WorkOrder and PhysicalPart as well
 * as ChangeOrder and Issue, so the generic `/items/:id/*` router no longer
 * answers a third way from either this predicate or the typed routers. The
 * one divergence that remains is the pre-existing and deliberate one recorded
 * on `physicalPartAccessScopeCondition` above — the by-id gate reads an
 * arbitrary lineage row while this admits on any reachable one — which is
 * inherited by the dispatch unchanged, and which the invariant that every
 * version of a part shares its design keeps from biting.
 *
 * Task stays admitted, and that is a ruling rather than an oversight.
 * `tasks.program_id` exists and the type handler writes it, but nothing in the
 * application ever supplies one and nothing can derive one: the only
 * structurally single-valued chain (`parent_task_id` → `items` → `designs`) is
 * written by no form and terminates in NULL anyway, because a task's parent is
 * another task and tasks carry no design; and `assignee` → `program_members`
 * is not a derivation at all but a circle, taking the authorization boundary
 * from the very membership table the boundary is checked against.
 *
 * That circle is the trap, and it is the thing the next reader will reach for,
 * because it resolves "exactly one" on a single-program install: it looks
 * right while being wrong by construction, and it is wrong precisely when a
 * second program exists — the only situation this predicate exists for.
 *
 * Scoping Task is therefore a decision to *require* a program at creation,
 * which takes every task already in an install dark with none of them
 * rescuable: `taskUpdateSchema` carries no `programId`, so a row scoped in
 * error has no repair path at all. Requiring a program is a two-part product
 * change — the create *and* update schemas, plus a membership-gated picker in
 * the form — not a predicate flip here.
 *
 * The ruling, made rather than deferred: a program is deliberately not
 * required at task creation, and Task is deliberately not scoped. It is a
 * scoped ruling, not an eternal one — it is right for an install where tasks
 * are instance-wide chores, and revisiting it is a product decision about
 * whether tasks are program-private data, not a bug fix. A test pins the
 * admission on both the list and the by-id surface so it cannot change by
 * accident.
 *
 * Lives here rather than beside any one caller because item lists, search,
 * dashboard counts and report execution all have to draw the boundary in the
 * same place. Three hand-rolled copies of the rule is three chances to get it
 * wrong.
