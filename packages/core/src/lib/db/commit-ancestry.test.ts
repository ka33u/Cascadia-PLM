/**
 * The ancestry walk enumerates commits, not paths.
 *
 * Complex-algorithm gate. This is the one property the rest of the versioning
 * suite structurally cannot see: `VersionResolver.test.ts` holds a 200-master
 * SQL-vs-in-memory equivalence oracle, and both of its arms share this walk, so
 * agreeing with each other says nothing about how many rows either produced.
 * Its fixture is also purely linear — no merge commits — which is exactly the
 * topology that hides the defect.
 *
 * ECO-as-Branch builds diamonds. A branch is cut at main's head, its commits
 * parent onto that chain, and `createMergeCommit` writes `parent_id` = main's
 * head together with `merge_parent_id` = the ECO's head. So every release
 * closes a diamond, and every diamond doubles the number of distinct
 * root-to-head paths while adding a constant number of commits.
 *
 * That divergence is the assertion. At 20 diamonds the graph holds 61 commits
 * and 2^20 = 1,048,576 paths. A walk that enumerates commits returns 61 rows
 * in milliseconds; the `UNION ALL` this replaced would return over a million
 * and take the test with it, which is why there is an explicit timeout rather
 * than a silent hang.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run packages/core/src/lib/db/commit-ancestry.test.ts
