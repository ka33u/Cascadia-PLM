 * Cascadia PLM MCP Server
 *
 * Publishes the PLM tool registry (`@/lib/ai/tools/registry`) over the
 * Model Context Protocol so external agents — Claude, IDE assistants,
 * other integrations — can search part data, walk BOMs, create ECOs, and
 * drive PLM workflows with the same tools, permission checks, and audit
 * logging as the in-app AI chatbot.
 *
 * A server instance is scoped to one authenticated user (and optionally a
 * narrowed API-key scope). The HTTP endpoint in `src/server/routes/mcp.ts`
 * creates one per request; every tool call runs through the registry
 * handlers, which enforce permissions and write `ai_usage_logs` rows.

const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `Cascadia PLM — Product Lifecycle Management tools.

Read tools (search_items, get_item_details, get_bom, get_where_used,
analyze_change_impact, search_programs, search_designs) answer questions
about parts, documents, BOMs, requirements, and change orders. Results are
scoped to what the authenticated user can access.

Write tools (create_item, update_item, create_relationship,
transition_item_state, create_change_order, create_program) use a two-step
confirmation flow: the first call returns { requiresConfirmation: true }
with a summary of what will happen and a single-use "confirmationToken".
Show the summary to the user, and only after they approve, repeat the exact
same call with that confirmationToken added. The token expires after a few
minutes, is bound to those exact parameters, and works once — changing any
parameter or reusing a token yields a fresh preview instead of executing.

Cascadia uses ECO-as-Branch versioning: released items in protected designs
cannot be modified directly. When a write tool responds with
suggestCreateChangeOrder, create a change order first (create_change_order), then
pass its changeOrderId to the write call.`
