/**
 * The jobs worker itself — everything except which modules are attached.
 *
 * An app entry registers its edition's modules and then calls
 * `runJobsWorker()`. Keeping the 100-odd lines of queue-naming and shutdown
 * logic here rather than duplicating them per app is the whole reason this is a
 * function and not an entry point.
 *
 * Environment variables:
 * - RABBITMQ_URL: RabbitMQ connection URL (default: amqp://localhost:5672)
 * - DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection URL
 * - WORKER_CONCURRENCY: Number of concurrent jobs (default: 5)
 * - JOB_TYPES: Comma-separated job type patterns (default: *)
 * - JOB_TIMEOUT: Job timeout in ms (default: 300000)
 * - HEALTH_PORT: Port for health check endpoint (default: 3002)
 * - JOB_RETRY_SWEEP_MS: Interval for the parked-retry sweep (default: 15000)
 * - JOB_QUEUED_STALE_MS: How long a 'queued' row may sit before that sweep
 *   treats its message as lost and re-publishes it (default: 600000). Keep it
 *   comfortably above the deployment's worst-case queue latency: a backlog
 *   older than it costs one duplicate delivery per row per window, which the
 *   claim discards.
 * - WORKER_RECONNECT_DEADLINE_MS: How long to retry a lost broker connection
 *   before exiting 1 for the restart policy to take over (default: 300000)
 * - WORKER_CLAIM_RETRY_DELAY_MS: How long a delivery whose claim could not be
 *   attempted — the database was unreachable — waits before it is requeued
 *   (default: 5000). Keep it to seconds: the prefetch slot is held for the
 *   duration, so a long delay turns an outage into a deadlock rather than
 *   into slow bouncing.
 * - WORKER_QUEUE_NAME: Override the derived queue name (default: derived from
 *   the routing patterns, so workers with the same JOB_TYPES share a queue)
 * - DLQ_CHECK_MS: How often the dead-letter queue's depth is read for
 *   /health, and how stale a cached depth may be (default: 30000)
 * - DLQ_WARN_DEPTH: Depth at which the worker logs a warning that the
 *   dead-letter queue needs draining (default: 100)

 * RabbitMQ connection dropped consumes nothing, and reporting 200 while
 * idle-forever is how that failure stayed invisible. 503 'disconnected'
 * matches the Python workers' health shape.
 *
 * `dlqDepth` reports the dead-letter queue, which nothing consumes: it is the
 * only place a poison message can be seen at all, and until it appeared here
 * an operator had to know to open the management UI. It is deliberately not
 * part of the health verdict — a worker with a backlog of undecodable
 * messages is doing its job correctly, and a queue nobody drains must not
 * make an orchestrator restart every worker in the fleet. `null` means the
 * depth is not known yet or the broker could not answer it; a monitor should
 * treat that as unknown rather than as zero. The value is served from a cache
 * the scheduler refreshes, so a poll every second costs the broker nothing.

 * Register the process-level backstops.

 * Node terminates the process on an unhandled rejection, and the worker had
 * enough uncontained `await`s on database calls that a transient Postgres
 * outage crash-looped it for the length of the outage. Those call sites are
 * now contained individually (see `JobWorker.handleMessage`); these two
 * handlers are what stops the *next* uncontained one doing the same thing,
 * and they turn a silent death into a log line either way.
 *
 * The two are answered differently on purpose. An unhandled rejection is
 * logged and survived: this process's state is a broker consumer and a map of
 * active jobs, and a promise nobody awaited corrupts neither — whatever job
 * was involved is recovered by the retry and stale-running sweeps, which is
 * strictly better than dropping every other in-flight job by exiting. An
 * uncaught exception unwound a synchronous stack from an unknown point and is
 * not survivable in the same way, so it is logged and the process exits 1 for
 * the restart policy to take over — the same answer `reconnectUntilDeadline`
 * gives an unreachable broker.
