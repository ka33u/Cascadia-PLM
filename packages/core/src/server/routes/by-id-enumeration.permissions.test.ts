/**
 * Every by-id route, enumerated — a non-member is refused, a member is not
 *
 * Security gate, and the ratchet the whole authorization sweep rests on.
 * AUTH-1..7 gated roughly a hundred and forty handlers by hand; hand-written
 * spot checks prove the shapes work, and cannot prove that none was missed.
 * This asks the routers themselves what they registered.
 *
 * Two legs, over the same list. As an **outsider** — a user holding every RBAC
 * verb but belonging to no program — every by-id route must answer 403. As a
 * **member**, the same request must answer anything *but* 403: 200, 400, 404
 * and 409 are all fine, because the point is that the refusal came from the
 * instance-level gate rather than from a malformed path or a missing row.
 *
 * Both users hold one role granting every resource except `programs:manage`,
 * which is the cross-program bypass. So RBAC can never be the reason for a
 * 403, and program membership is the only difference between them.
 *
 * The suite also refuses to let a new item type in unnoticed: the map of
 * fixtures is asserted exhaustive against `ITEM_TYPE_RESOURCES`, which has its
 * own test pinning it against `ITEM_TYPE_DEFINITIONS`. A fourteenth type fails
 * here until someone gives it a fixture.
 *
 * Most mounts are item routers; two are not. `/api/v1/files` is the vault,
 * and `/api/v1/branches` gates on the design behind the branch rather than on
 * an item — `requireBranchAccess`, whose other shape, a branch named in a
 * request body, no enumeration over path ids can reach and which
 * `branches.permissions.test.ts` covers instead.
 *
 * `PUT /branches/:id` is the one to know about on that mount: both its body
 * fields are optional, so `{}` is a valid body that reaches the handler
 * rather than a 400 in the wrapper. It is also the one branches route that
 * does not call `requireBranchAccess` — it asks `ProgramService.getUserRole`
 * for lead or admin, which is narrower. The outsider is refused by that check
 * and the member is not, because the fixture's member created the program and
 * `ProgramService.create` enrols its creator as admin. With both flags absent
 * the handler writes nothing, so the member leg does not consume the branch.
 *
 * One wrinkle worth naming: a route declaring `body:` validates in the
 * wrapper, before the handler's access check. An empty request to such a
 * route is a 400 that never reached the gate — which is not a disclosure,
 * because the rejection is decided by the body alone and a member sending the
 * same request gets the same 400. The outsider leg accepts that pair and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * The allowlist is the ratchet. Each entry names a route whose gate is shaped
 * by something other than the id — a branch named in the body, mostly — and
 * carries the reason. It should only ever shrink. A route that parses its body
 * before authorizing shows up as a 400 in the outsider leg: that is the test
 * working, and the fix belongs in the route, never here.
 *
 * Companion suites, kept because enumeration cannot explain itself:
 * `item-access.permissions.test.ts` (one route per shape),
 * `by-id-access.permissions.test.ts` (the non-design axes, and the deliberate
 * exceptions), `files.permissions.test.ts` (the vault, including the mixed
 * batch).
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run packages/core/src/server/routes/by-id-enumeration.permissions.test.ts
