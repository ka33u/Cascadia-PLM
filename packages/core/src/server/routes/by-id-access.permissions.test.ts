/**
 * The remaining by-id surfaces — program isolation
 *
 * Security gate. AUTH-2 closed the type-specific route files; this covers what
 * was left: the generic `items` sub-routes (transition, lock, relationships,
 * files), `requirements`, and the two physical-lane files whose rows carry no
 * `designId` at all and so need their own derivation.
 *
 * One route per family rather than all seventy-five. Every user here holds the
 * same RBAC role, so a 403 can only come from the instance-level gate:
 *
 *  - a generic sub-route that mutates through a service AUTH-1 does not cover
 *    (`POST /items/:id/transition` goes through LifecycleService)
 *  - a generic sub-route that reads (`GET /items/:id/relationships`)
 *  - a lock, which writes the items row directly (`POST /items/:id/lock`)
 *  - the vault-adjacent file listing (`GET /items/:itemId/files`)
 *  - a requirement sub-route (`GET /requirements/:id/derive`)
 *  - a physical instance, scoped through the part it instantiates
 *  - a work order, scoped through the program it names
 *  - both of those again on the *generic* `/items/:id/*` router, which for a
 *    long time was the one surface that answered a third way
 *  - an issue, scoped on whichever of its three axes it carries, plus the
 *    repair path that keeps a row with none of them fixable
 *  - the three version-context reads (`at-context`, `available-contexts`,
 *    `history`), which hand-rolled a design check that an ECO — whose
 *    `items.design_id` is always NULL — passed vacuously
