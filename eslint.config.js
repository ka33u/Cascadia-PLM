  // it, and every mount refetches. It is the load-bearing member of the five
  // replaced idioms catalogued in docs/development/data-fetching.md.
  //
  // Two rules, because one shape is syntax and the other is reachability:
  //
  //  - The esquery descendant selector matches a fetch WRITTEN inside the
  //    effect, including one nested in an inner async function declared
  //    there. That is all a syntax matcher can see.
  //  - `local/no-indirect-effect-fetch` matches a fetch the effect REACHES:
  //    a sibling function — plain, `function`-declared, or `useCallback`-
  //    wrapped — that the effect calls or depends on. That shape passed the
  //    selector while doing exactly what it forbids.
  //
  // An earlier version of this comment claimed the conversion batches had
  // removed the indirect shape and no rule was needed. They had not: the
  // rule found ten files on the day it was written, eight of them absent
  // from the audit that made the claim. Do not replace a gate with a
  // sentence about a gate.
  //
  // One honest limitation remains, documented rather than chased: CROSS-FILE
  // indirection. Scope analysis resolves an imported name to its import, not
  // to the function behind it, so an effect calling a fetching helper from
  // another module is not matched. Following that would mean resolving
  // modules inside a lint rule, and the query layer's own review is a better
  // place to catch it.
  //
  // Both rules cover `.ts` as well as `.tsx` under these directories. They
  // were `.tsx`-only until this block was widened, which exempted precisely
  // the files most likely to hold the pattern: a `useXData.ts` hook is where
  // an effect-fetch goes once it is factored out of a component. Two live
  // ones sat there unreported the whole time — see the allowlist below.
  // The LIKE-pattern selectors are spread back in because the `.ts` block
  // above matches these files too and options override rather than merge.
