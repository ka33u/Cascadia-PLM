# Cascadia PLM System

> A code-first Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system built with Hono + Vite SPA

Cascadia is a modern PLM system designed to replace traditional low-code PLM platforms like Aras Innovator. It prioritizes developer experience, type safety, and customization through code rather than UI-based configuration.

**Signature Feature**: ECO-as-Branch - Each Engineering Change Order gets its own isolated branch for parallel development, with Git-style versioning for all engineering data.

## Try the Demo

The fastest way to see Cascadia is the bundled demo stack — Postgres, RabbitMQ, the app (with embedded vault), the CAD converter, and the jobs worker, pre-seeded with a real engineering dataset (TDJ-25 6-DOF robot arm: ~88 parts, 101 BOM relationships, 79 colored GLBs + STEPs). No clone required:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cascadia-PLM/Cascadia-App/main/docker-compose.demo.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d
```

First run pulls ~1.2 GB of pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry (2-5 min on a typical connection) and seeds the database. When `docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml logs app` shows the server is listening, open <http://localhost:3000> and log in with `admin@cascadia.local` / `Cascadia`. Navigate to **Programs → ROBOT-ARM → TDJ-25** to explore the BOM tree, click any part with CAD to see the 3D viewer, and check the ECO **Initial Release - TDJ-25 Robot Arm** to see the signature ECO-as-Branch workflow in its released state.

Reset to a clean slate at any time:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml down -v
```

The demo's volumes are namespaced (`cascadia_demo_*`) and won't touch any local dev data.

Working from a clone instead? Use [`docker-compose.demo-with-build.yml`](./docker-compose.demo-with-build.yml) to build images from your working tree.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- PostgreSQL 18+
- npm or pnpm
- Docker (optional, for RabbitMQ)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials

# Set up database (dev: diff-apply the schema directly)
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application. The minimal seed creates a bootstrap admin account (`admin@cascadia.local` / `Cascadia`) for local development only — **change this password immediately in any shared or production deployment**.

For detailed setup instructions, see [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

## Core Concepts

### ECO-as-Branch Workflow

1. **Create ECO** - Creates a branch from main
2. **Checkout Items** - Items are copied to the ECO branch
3. **Make Changes** - Edits are isolated to the branch
4. **Approve & Release** - Merge to main, assign revision letters (A, B, C...)

**Change Actions**: Release (new item), Revise (new revision), Obsolete, Add to BOM, Remove from BOM

### Organizational Hierarchy

- **Organization** - Top-level entity
- **Program** - Permission boundary, users are members of programs
- **Design** - Version container with branches and commits
- **Items** - Parts, Documents, Requirements, etc.

### Item Types

All item types extend `BaseItem` and register via `ItemTypeRegistry`:

- **Part** - Physical components with materials, costs, lead times
- **Document** - Version-controlled files
- **ChangeOrder** - ECOs that coordinate changes across items
- **Requirement** - Traceable requirements
- **Task** - Work items for workflows
- **TestPlan** / **TestCase** - Test campaigns and their procedures
- **WorkInstruction** - Step-by-step manufacturing instructions
- **Issue** - Defects and action items
- **Software** - Firmware/software configuration items with a source store
- **Tool** - Manufacturing and quality equipment
- **PhysicalPart** - Serialized units and lots (the digital twin record)
- **WorkOrder** - Manufacturing execution and traceability anchor

See [docs/features/item-types.md](./docs/features/item-types.md) for the full reference.

### Admin Capabilities

- User and role management with RBAC
- Lifecycle and workflow configuration
- Background jobs dashboard with monitoring
- Health check endpoint (`/api/v1/health`)

### Service Layer

Business logic is centralized in services:

```typescript
// Create a new part
const part = await ItemService.create(
  'Part',
  {
    itemNumber: 'P-1001',
    name: 'Widget Assembly',
    partType: 'Manufacture',
  },
  userId,
)

// Checkout to an ECO branch
await CheckoutService.checkout(part.id, ecoId, userId)

// Get item at a specific version context
const versionedPart = await VersionResolver.getItemAtContext(part.masterId, {
  branchId,
  commitId,
})
```

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev           # Start dev server on port 3000
npm run build         # Build for production
npm run serve         # Preview production build

# Database
npm run db:push       # Diff-apply schema directly (dev/CI/demo only)
npm run db:generate   # Mint migration SQL into apps/cascadia/drizzle/ (CI drift gate)
npm run db:migrate    # Apply committed migrations (the upgrade path for released installs)
npm run db:studio     # Open Drizzle Studio GUI
npm run db:seed       # Minimal seed (admin, roles, program, standard library)
npm run db:reset      # Truncate all tables only
npm run db:reset:seed # Truncate all tables + reseed

# Testing
npm run test          # Run Vitest tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
npm run test:e2e      # Run Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui   # Run E2E tests with UI

# Background Jobs (requires Docker)
docker compose up -d rabbitmq
docker compose --profile dev up jobs-worker-dev -d

# Code Quality
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run format        # Prettier
npm run check         # Format + lint fix
```

### Adding a New Item Type

1. Define the type and Zod schema in `packages/core/src/lib/items/types/`
2. Add database columns in `packages/core/src/lib/db/schema/items.ts`
3. Create form, table, and detail components
4. Register the type in `ItemTypeRegistry`
5. Run `npm run db:push`
6. If the type gets its own table, add it to `ALL_TABLES` in `scripts/truncate-all.ts`

## Deployment

Cascadia supports flexible deployment options:

| Deployment     | Best For                    | Documentation                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Single Server  | Development, small teams    | `docs/orchestration/deployments/single-server/`  |
| Distributed    | HA, 50+ users               | `docs/orchestration/deployments/distributed/`    |
| Cloud Database | Managed DB (RDS, Cloud SQL) | `docs/orchestration/deployments/cloud-database/` |
| Kubernetes     | Enterprise, auto-scaling    | `docs/orchestration/deployments/kubernetes/`     |

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Start with background job worker
docker compose --profile dev up -d
```

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/cascadia
NODE_ENV=development
```

Optional:

```
VAULT_ROOT=/path/to/vault   # Default: ./vault (a DB storage setting overrides)
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://localhost  # For background jobs
```

There is no session secret to configure: sessions are opaque random tokens
stored hashed in the database.

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the full list.

## Testing

Cascadia has comprehensive test coverage:

- Unit tests for all services (Vitest)
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- API route integration tests
- E2E browser tests (Playwright) with page object model
- CI via GitHub Actions

```bash
npm run test          # Run all unit/integration tests
npm run test:e2e      # Run Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

## CAD Integration

Cascadia stores and serves CAD files (STEP, IGES, SolidWorks, and more) through its file vault, with server-side conversion to STL/GLB for in-browser 3D preview. Native CAD connectors (Solid Edge, SolidWorks) that push parts and BOMs directly from CAD are on the roadmap but not yet implemented.
