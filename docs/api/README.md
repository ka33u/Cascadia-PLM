# Cascadia API

The Cascadia HTTP API is mounted under `/api/v1/` and described by an OpenAPI 3.1 document.

## Where to find the contract

| Surface            | Path                          | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Live spec          | `GET /openapi.json`           | Generated from route metadata on every request — never stale       |
| Live docs UI       | `GET /api/docs`               | [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) — try requests interactively         |
| Frozen v1 contract | `docs/api/openapi.v1.json`    | Snapshot committed to this repo; the authoritative v1 contract     |
| Generation script  | `scripts/snapshot-openapi.ts` | `npm run openapi:snapshot` rewrites the snapshot from the live app |

## Versioning policy

- **v1 is frozen** as of the commit that introduced this file. The spec at `docs/api/openapi.v1.json` is the contract external consumers should rely on.
- **Additive changes only** until v2 is cut. New endpoints, new optional fields, new response keys are fine. Removing a field, narrowing a type, or changing a required value is a **breaking change** and requires bumping to `/api/v2/`.
- **One narrow exception: an optional request-body property the server has never stored** may be dropped from the snapshot without cutting v2. Body schemas are non-strict, so such a property is already discarded on arrival — a request that sends it succeeds identically before and after, and the only effect is that a generated client stops offering an input that was a no-op. The exception is the never-stored clause and nothing else: it does not license removing a property the server reads, narrowing a type or a `minLength`, tightening required-ness, or touching any response field. Applied so far to `rationale` on `PUT /api/v1/requirements/{id}` and `taskType` on `PUT /api/v1/tasks/{id}`; record any future use here.
- **Breaking changes** mean a new path prefix (`/api/v2/`), a separate snapshot (`docs/api/openapi.v2.json`), and a deprecation window for `/api/v1/`. Don't mutate v1 in place.
- **The spec's `info.version` is the contract version, not the product version.** It stays `1.0.0` for the life of v1; the product version is reported by `GET /api/v1/health`.

## v1 semantics worth knowing

Deliberate v1 behaviors that look like accidents until written down:

- **Updates are `PUT` with partial semantics.** Update endpoints accept a
  partial body and merge it — there is no `PATCH` in v1, and none will be
  added to it (a semantically strict `PUT`/`PATCH` split is v2 material).
  Omitted fields are left unchanged; explicit `null` clears where the field
  is nullable.
- **Listing goes through `/api/v1/items`.** Type-specific route modules
  (`/parts`, `/documents`, `/requirements`, …) serve detail and actions from
  `GET /:id` up; enumerating items of a type is the items API's job
  (`?types=Part` etc.). `work-orders` carries its own root list for
  historical reasons — grandfathered, not the pattern.
- **Pagination defaults are per-endpoint, and the snapshot is the
  authority.** Most list endpoints default `limit` to 50 via the shared
  pagination schema; some surfaces deliberately differ (admin listings 100,
  enterprise search 25, item search per-branch). New endpoints use the
  shared schema's default unless there is a written reason not to.

## How the spec is generated

Every route module in `packages/core/src/server/routes/` declares a default tag at the top of the file:

```typescript
import { tagged } from '../adapter'
const adapt = tagged('Parts')
```

Handlers use the existing `apiHandler({...}, fn)` pattern and may attach OpenAPI metadata:

```typescript
app.get(
  '/:id',
  adapt(
    apiHandler(
      {
        permission: ['parts', 'read'],
        openapi: {
          summary: 'Get a part by ID',
          request: { params: z.object({ id: z.string().uuid() }) },
          responses: {
            200: { schema: z.object({ part: partResponseSchema }) },
          },
        },
      },
      async ({ params }) => {
        // handler logic
      },
    ),
  ),
)
```

The shared error envelope (400/401/403/404/500) is added automatically by `metadataToSpec` in `packages/core/src/lib/api/openapi-helpers.ts`. Success payloads are wrapped in the standard `{ data: ... }` envelope.

## Documenting a request body

Point `request.body.schema` at the Zod schema the route already validates
against — the service's own `xCreateSchema`, not a hand-written copy, or the
two drift and the document becomes fiction:

```typescript
openapi: {
  summary: 'Create a program',
  request: { body: { schema: programCreateSchema } },
  responses: {
    201: { schema: z.object({ program: programResponseSchema }) },
  },
}
```

Three options on the body, all optional:

| Field         | Use                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mediaType`   | Anything that is not `application/json`. `multipart/form-data` for uploads; describe file parts with `z.file()`. |
| `required`    | `false` for a route that runs on defaults when the body is absent. Defaults to `true`.                           |
| `description` | Long-form notes. Prefer the operation's own `description` — Scalar gives it more room.                           |

Bodies, path params and query params are all described from the **input** side
of the schema, so a field with `.default()` shows as optional with its default
listed rather than as required. `.describe()` on a field carries through to the
document, and is the cheapest way to explain a field an integrator cannot guess.

Note that the schemas are converted here rather than handed to hono-openapi's
`resolver()`: that returns a proxy the generator only awaits for _responses_, so
a resolver in a body position serialises as the literal `{ "vendor": "zod" }`.
`packages/core/src/lib/api/openapi-helpers.test.ts` guards against that
regressing — it is invisible in every other check.

## CI gate

`npm run openapi:check` regenerates the spec and diffs it against `docs/api/openapi.v1.json`. It runs on pushes to `main`, **not on pull requests** — the committed snapshot is refreshed by the maintainers, so adding or changing a route without touching `docs/api/openapi.v1.json` is expected, and nothing in a contributor's PR turns red because of it.

## Generating a typed client

External consumers can generate a TypeScript client from the snapshot:

```bash
npx openapi-typescript docs/api/openapi.v1.json -o api-types.d.ts
```

Or use any OpenAPI-compatible toolchain (Kiota, openapi-generator, Stoplight, etc.).

## v2 backlog

v1 is frozen, so every rename in the change-management remediation is additive on the wire: new paths mount beside the old ones, response keys are never removed, and persisted values that appear in responses keep their spelling. What could not be done additively is collected here, to be taken up together when v2 is cut — after the lifecycle consolidation, as its own project.

- **Persisted values that appear in responses.** `branchType: 'eco'` and `tagType: 'eco-release'`; the code reads them as `BRANCH_TYPES.changeOrder` and `TAG_TYPES.changeOrderRelease` (`packages/core/src/lib/versioning/branch-types.ts`), and the `eco/` branch-name prefix goes with them.
- **Columns and the properties that mirror them.** `program_members.can_create_eco` / `can_approve_eco` (`canCreateEco`, `canApproveEco`); `conflict_reviews.their_eco_id` (`theirEcoId`, with `theirEcoNumber`); `work_instruction_change_alerts.eco_id`; `upstream_changes.source_eco_id` / `response_eco_id`.
- **Request and response properties.** `ecoId`, `ecoTitle`, `ecoDescription`, `ecoNumber`, `ecoName`, `ecoBranches`, `ecoBranch`, `ecoDesign`, `ecos`, `isInEco`.
- **Path aliases kept for v1.** `/designs/{id}/ecos` (now `/designs/{id}/change-orders`), `/workspaces/{id}/convert-to-eco` and `/merge-to-eco` (now `-change-order`), and `/workflows*`, now mounted canonically at `/lifecycles*` (whose responses keep the `lifecycles` / `workflow` keys for the same reason).
- **`workflowType: 'strict' | 'flexible'`**, a response property and a `NOT NULL` column, becomes `structure: 'fixed' | 'per-instance'`.
- **The `workflows` permission resource** became `lifecycles` in the lifecycle consolidation — the roles API enumerates no resource names, so it did not have to wait. Stored role and API-key maps were migrated; the server reads `workflows` as `lifecycles` for one release.
- **Job payload keys.** `notification.workinstruction.partchanged` accepts `changeOrderId` and, for one release, the `ecoId` it shipped with; the old key is dropped after that.
